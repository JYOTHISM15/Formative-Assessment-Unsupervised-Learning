# 1. **Introduction**
   - **Description:** Introduce the problem and dataset. Mention that the goal is to apply clustering techniques to the Iris dataset.
   

## Objective
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques (clustering algorithms) to the Iris dataset to understand its structure. The goal is to cluster the data into groups based on similar characteristics without using the species labels, as this is a clustering task.


# 2. Loading and Preprocessing 
   - **Steps:**
     1. Load the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
     2. Drop the species column since this is a clustering problem.
     3. Optionally, normalize or standardize the features if needed.


### Import necessary libraries

### Load the Iris dataset

### Convert to DataFrame for easier handling

### Check the first few rows


# 3. **Clustering Algorithm Implementation**
# A) **KMeans Clustering 
   - **Explanation:**
     - **How KMeans works:** KMeans is an iterative algorithm that divides a dataset into `k` clusters. It assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center and re-computes the cluster centers until convergence.
     - **Why suitable for the Iris dataset:** KMeans can work well here since the Iris dataset likely has distinct groupings (the three Iris species), and KMeans can effectively separate such groups based on feature similarities.


### KMeans Clustering
KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that assigns each data point to the nearest centroid. The algorithm iterates over the data points, adjusting centroids until they no longer move significantly. This is suitable for the Iris dataset, as we expect the dataset to have distinct natural clusters based on the features.

###Import KMeans from sklearn


### Apply KMeans clustering (assuming 3 clusters, as there are 3 species)


### Visualizing the clusters


# B) **Hierarchical Clustering 
   - **Explanation:**
     - **How Hierarchical Clustering works:** Hierarchical clustering creates a tree-like structure of nested clusters. It can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down). We will use agglomerative clustering, which begins by treating each data point as its own cluster and then merges clusters based on similarity.
     - **Why suitable for the Iris dataset:** Hierarchical clustering is good for smaller datasets like Iris and can reveal the structure of clusters at different levels, which is useful for understanding the natural grouping of Iris species.


### Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering creates a hierarchy of clusters. It starts with each data point as its own cluster and merges the closest pairs of clusters iteratively. It is suitable for the Iris dataset because it can reveal the nested structure of the data, showing how individual points cluster together at various levels.



### Importing necessary libraries for Hierarchical Clustering


### Apply Hierarchical Clustering (using 3 clusters)


### Visualizing the clusters


# 4. **Conclusion and Summary**
   - **Wrap-up:** Discuss the results of both clustering algorithms, any observations on the clustering behavior, and whether the clusters match the true species (which, of course, won't be known since it's unsupervised).
   

## Conclusion
In this exercise, we applied two unsupervised clustering techniques (KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering) to the Iris dataset. We observed that both algorithms successfully identified three clusters, aligning with the natural grouping of Iris species. However, due to the unsupervised nature of the task, we did not use the actual species labels, but clustering can still provide valuable insights into the underlying data structure.
